Rooted: A Midseason Healing Circle

Date: June 22, 2025
Location: candle making room

A quiet pause between blooms.
This intimate gathering (10 guests max) is for the ones in between — no longer who they were, not yet who they’re becoming. Through gentle breathwork, reflection prompts, and a candle-making experience, you’ll reconnect with your intentions and restore your emotional soil.

• Guided journaling & somatic grounding
• Personalized candle-making experience.
• Breathwork for clarity & calm
• Private group sharing + closing intention.
