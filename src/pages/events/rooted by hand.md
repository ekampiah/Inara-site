A Clay & Reflection Experience by Inara

🎟 Spots: Limited to 10 guests

✨ About the Experience

This is where the journey lands.
A soft ending. A soulful beginning. A return to the self you’ve been writing your way back to.

Rooted by Hand is a ceremonial closing for Inara’s 30-Day Journaling Challenge and a featured offering in our Bloom Series—a collection of intimate, healing-centered gatherings that nurture your growth, inside and out.

Through hand-built clay forms, grounding experiences, and guided reflection, this workshop is a space to express all that has bloomed within you. A way to mark your transformation—not just in ink, but in your hands.

⸻

🖌 What to Expect
• A grounding breathwork + stillness practice
• A short guided journaling prompt to reflect on your 30-day journey
• A hands-on clay experience—make intention bowls, story vessels, or symbolic forms
• A closing circle with collective affirmation + gentle release ritual

No art experience is needed—just a willingness to be present. All materials provided.

🌱 Why Clay?

Because healing is a tactile process.
Because the body remembers.
Because creating with your hands is another way to write your truth.
